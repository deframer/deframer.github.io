News Deframer will detect journalistic neutrality and framing in news articles. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), it analyzes the news headlines. It can act as an **RSS Feed Proxy** or as a **browser plugin**.

## We replace the portal page

An Ad-Blocker blocks ads you don't want. The News Deframer vaporizes the mental impact of clickbait by replacing the portal page of any major news network with neutral language.

A score of 50% or higher suggests significant bias. In other words: A trained professional journalist is using words to mess with you and the AI will telly you where and how. The title or the description is clickbait, framing, hyper stimulus or pushing an agenda.

## What this project is and is not

- This is **not** a fake news detector!
- This project uses an LLM acting as a neutral journalist to analyze content for bias and adherence to neutral language.
- We use open transparent [prompts](https://github.com/deframer/news-deframer/blob/main/pkg/think/prompts) that can be run on any LLM.

## Why is language analysis effective

- We aim to help you avoid engaging with questionable headlines.
- Misinformation and speculation often rely on dark patterns, clickbait, and emotional triggers.
- Authors of misinformation often use disguise and vague language to avoid legal repercussions.

**WARNING**: We can have false positives / negatives.
