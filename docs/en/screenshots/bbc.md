## Portal

The plugin overlays the original web page to provide a distraction-free environment.

**Key Features:**

- **Neutralized Content**: You will not see the original, potentially emotionally charged titles or descriptions. Instead, the AI generates neutral summaries designed to inform rather than provoke.
- **Sensationalism Score**: The percentage indicator reveals the level of detected sensationalism or bias. A red indicator suggests high levels of manipulation, framing, bias, or misinformation.

**Recommendation**: A score of 50% or higher suggests significant bias. We recommend seeking alternative sources for a more balanced perspective.

**Quick Insights**: Hovering over the percentage bar reveals the detailed analysis from the News Deframer. This often provides enough context to skip the full article.

## Article

You retain full control over your reading experience. The plugin intercepts navigation to article URLs. Regardless of whether you access the article via the portal or a direct link, News Deframer always presents the analysis preview first to protect you.

**Important Note**: The plugin currently analyzes only the RSS feed metadata (title and description). The body of the article remains untouched. Future updates may include full-text AI analysis triggered via human trusted flaggers.

- **"Hide" Button**: Dismisses the Deframer overlay to reveal the original article on the publisher's site.
- **Protected Viewing**: By default, the original title and description are hidden to reduce emotional impact. You can choose to expand the view to see the AI's reasoning and the original text.
